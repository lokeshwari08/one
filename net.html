    <h1>Elephants</h1>
    <p>
    <h2>Elephants are the largest land mammals, with two main species:</h2><br>
    <h3>African elephants (which include the larger bush elephant and the smaller forest elephant) and the Asian
        elephant.</h3> <br>They are known for their large ears, long trunks, and tusks, which are used for feeding,
    digging, and defense.<br> Elephants are herbivores, consuming large amounts of vegetation, including grass, leaves,
    and bark. They live in matriarchal herds, led by the oldest female, and are highly social animals, communicating
    through sounds and vibrations.<mark> With a lifespan of up to 70 years, elephants have a long gestation period of
        about 22 months</mark>. However, they face threats from poaching for their ivory, habitat loss, and
    human-wildlife conflict.<br> Despite these challenges, they play a crucial role in ecosystems by dispersing seeds
    and shaping their environment.</p>

        <p class="liki"><i>One Rare and fascinating aspect of elephants is their ability to "hear" with their
                feet</i>.<br> Elephants communicate not only through vocalizations but also by sending low-frequency
            sounds, or infrasound, through the ground.<br> Other elephants can detect these vibrations with the
            sensitive cells in their feet, allowing them to "hear" distant calls or the movements of other elephants
            miles away. <br>This ability is particularly useful in dense forests or across large savannas where visual
            or auditory signals may not travel as effectively. Additionally, elephants have been observed to show signs
            of empathy and mourning.<br> They have been known to carefully touch and caress the bones or bodies of
            deceased elephants <s>so are</s>,suggesting they experience a form of grief, which is extremely rare in the
            animal kingdom.</p>
